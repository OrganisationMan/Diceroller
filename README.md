# Diceroller
Diceroller application with React Native

There's two methods of doing this.
1. Creating the dices and dots with styling natively.
2. Creating the dices in Figma and export as an .png or convert to .svg.
It is first and foremost an tutorial, therefore, the amount of transmited information needs to be limited and match that of a beginner to React Native.
So to keep it isolated I went with 1. and will upload the whole project here.
